        Only intended to work with nnInteractiveTrainerV2 and its derivatives

        ``use_torch_compile``: compile the network with ``torch.compile``. The
        first prediction after enabling this is slow (compilation happens lazily
        on the first forward pass), but every subsequent prediction is faster.
        This is recommended for the persistent inference server, where the
        process is long-lived so the one-time compile cost is paid only once and
        amortized across the whole session lifetime.

        ``enable_undo``: keep single-level undo of the last interaction available
        (default ``True``; see ``undo()``). Undo works by snapshotting the
        interaction tensor and target buffer before each interaction, which costs
        extra RAM (a compressed copy of both) and some background CPU per
        prediction. Set to ``False`` when you know you will never call ``undo()``
        to skip that overhead entirely; ``undo()`` then always returns ``False``
        and ``supports_undo`` reports ``False``.

        ``interactions_storage``: storage backend for the interaction tensor, one of
        ``"blosc2"``, ``"tensor"`` or ``"auto"`` (default).
        ``"blosc2"`` keeps it as a compact blosc2 in-memory NDArray (low RAM, pays
        (de)compression on every read/write). ``"tensor"`` stores it as a dense CPU
        float16 ``torch.Tensor`` (more RAM, far lower per-access overhead; pinned memory
        by default, skipped when ``device`` is not CUDA or on Linux kernel 6.11 where
        pinning is buggy). ``"auto"`` decides per image at initialization from the
        interaction tensor's voxel count: at most ``AUTO_TENSOR_MAX_VOXELS`` (512*512*1024)
        spatial voxels uses ``"tensor"``, larger uses ``"blosc2"``.

        This serves two purposes:

        * **torch.compile**: with compilation enabled the network is compiled
          lazily on its first forward pass, which would otherwise make the user's
          *first* real prediction slow. The dummy pass triggers that compilation
          here instead.
        * **Device initialization (CUDA)**: even *without* ``torch.compile`` the
          first forward pass on a fresh CUDA device pays one-off costs — cuDNN
          autotunes/selects its convolution algorithms (``cudnn.benchmark`` is
          enabled for CUDA in ``__init__`` and fires here), the caching allocator
          grows its memory pool, and the CUDA context/kernels are loaded. Running
          the dummy pass at startup pays those costs here rather than on the user's
          first prediction.

        Every prediction path — the initial coarse pass, the zoom-out iterations,
        and the refinement patches — feeds the network an input of identical shape
        ``[1, num_input_channels + num_interaction_channels, *patch_size]``
        (``_build_network_input`` always resizes the crop to ``patch_size``, and
        refinement crops at exactly ``patch_size``). So a single dummy pass at that
        shape populates the compile cache and the cuDNN algorithm cache for every
        subsequent real prediction.

        Does nothing when there is nothing to gain: the network is neither compiled
        (no compile cache to populate) nor on a CUDA device (no cuDNN autotuning /
        allocator pool / context init to warm), so a dummy pass would not save the
        user any time. Mirrors ``_predict``'s autocast/inference-mode context and
        the float32 input dtype that ``torch.cat`` produces when concatenating the
