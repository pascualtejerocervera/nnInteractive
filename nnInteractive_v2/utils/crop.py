        bbox (sequence of [int, int]): A bounding box for each dimension of the source tensor
            that is covered by the bbox. The bbox is defined as [start, end) (half-open interval)

            without decompressing channel 0.

    Behavior:
        For each dimension that the bbox covers (i.e. the last len(bbox) dims of source_tensor):

            - Use slice(None) to include the entire dimension (or source_leading_slice for the
              first leading dim when provided).
        If source_tensor and target_tensor are on different devices, only the overlapping subregion
        is transferred to the device of target_tensor.
